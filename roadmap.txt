2. User Authentication
Signup and Login Pages: Create basic signup and login forms using React components.
Authentication Logic: Implement simple JWT-based authentication.
Protected Routes: Use middleware or higher-order components to protect routes that require authentication.
Key Focus Areas:

Understanding form handling in React.
Learning about state management (useState, useEffect).
Implementing basic authentication logic.
3. Dashboard Layout
Basic Dashboard Page: Create a dashboard page that users see after logging in.
Navigation Bar: Implement a simple navigation bar with links to different sections (e.g., Invoices, Expenses, Reports).
Sidebar: Optional, but useful for navigation if you have many sections.
Key Focus Areas:

Building reusable components (e.g., Navbar, Sidebar).
Using React Router (if not using Next.js' built-in routing).
4. Invoicing Module
Invoice List Page: Create a page to display a list of invoices.

Fetch invoices from a mock API or local state for now.
Display invoice details such as invoice number, client, amount, and status.
Create Invoice Form: Implement a form to create new invoices.

Include fields for client name, invoice items, quantities, prices, and total amount calculation.
Key Focus Areas:

Form handling with controlled components.
Data fetching with fetch or axios.
State management to handle lists and forms.
5. Expense Tracking
Expense List Page: Create a page to display a list of expenses.

Similar to the invoice list, fetch and display expense data.
Add Expense Form: Implement a form to add new expenses.

Include fields for expense name, category, amount, and date.
Key Focus Areas:

Reusing patterns from the invoicing module.
Further practice with forms and state management.
6. Basic Reporting
Overview Dashboard: Create a simple dashboard with key metrics.

Display total income, total expenses, and net profit.

Data visualization techniques.
Aggregating and transforming data for reports.
7. User Management
User Profile Page: Create a page where users can update their profile information.
Role-based Access: Implement basic role-based access control.
For now, hardcode user roles like "admin" and "user" and control access to certain features based on these roles.

Understanding user roles and permissions.
Secure data handling and form updates.
8. Inventory Management (Optional, Advanced)

The user should be able to edit the order details.
mark the order as delivered, cancelled or partially delivered.
provide notifications about the orders delievery date.

Advanced state management.
Integrating multiple modules (invoicing and inventory).
Incremental Development and Testing
Start Small: Focus on getting each feature working individually before integrating them.
Testing: Write simple unit tests for your components and integration tests for critical user flows.
Feedback and Iteration: Regularly test your app and seek feedback. Iterate on features based on user feedback and testing results.
